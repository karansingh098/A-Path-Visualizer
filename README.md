# A-Path-Visualizer
Created a 2-D shortest path visualizer using the pygame python library. Implemented the program using the priority queue variation of the A* search algorithm and the Manhattan distance formula as a heuristic based on the grid format. This project allows the user to place the start and end nodes in a grid display, and the program shows a visual display of the algorithm in action as well as the optimized shortest path.
